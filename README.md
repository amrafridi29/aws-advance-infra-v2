# AWS Advanced Infrastructure with Terraform

This repository contains a clean, industry-standard folder structure for AWS infrastructure using Terraform.

## 🏗️ Folder Structure

```
aws-advance-infra/
├── backend/                    # Global backend infrastructure
│   ├── s3/                    # S3 bucket for Terraform state
│   └── dynamodb/              # DynamoDB for state locking
├── environments/               # Environment-specific configurations
│   ├── staging/               # Staging environment

```

## 🎯 Next Steps

We'll build this infrastructure step by step:

1. **Backend Infrastructure** - S3 + DynamoDB for state management
2. **Networking Module** - VPC, subnets, and routing
3. **Security Module** - IAM, KMS, and security groups
4. **Storage Module** - S3, EBS, and RDS
5. **Compute Module** - EC2, ECS, and Lambda
6. **Monitoring Module** - CloudWatch and CloudTrail
7. **Staging Environment** - Complete staging setup
8. **Production Environment** - Complete production setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is just the folder structure. We'll populate each directory step by step as we learn and build together.
