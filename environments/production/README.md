# Production Environment

This directory contains the Terraform configuration for the production environment.

## 🎯 Purpose

The production environment is designed for:

- **Development and Testing**: Safe environment for testing infrastructure changes
- **Pre-production Validation**: Verifying configurations before production deployment
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work and test simultaneously
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses smaller instance types and fewer resources

## 🏗️ How It Works

This environment **uses modules** to build infrastructure:

```
environments/production/
├── main.tf               # Calls modules to build infrastructure
├── variables.tf          # Environment-specific variables
├── terraform.tfvars      # Production-specific values
├── outputs.tf            # Environment outputs
└── README.md             # This file
```

## 🔗 Module Usage

The production environment calls these modules:

- **networking** - VPC, subnets, routing
- **security** - IAM, KMS, security groups
- **storage** - S3, EBS, RDS
- **compute** - EC2, ECS, Lambda
- **monitoring** - CloudWatch, CloudTrail

## 🚀 Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Backend infrastructure must be deployed first
- AWS credentials configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed

### Steps

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Review the plan**:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the configuration**:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform output
   ```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Network Security**: Private subnets for sensitive resources
- **Access Control**: IAM roles with least privilege principle
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- **Instance Types**: Smaller, cost-effective instances
- **Auto Scaling**: Scale down during off-hours
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated cleanup of unused resources
- **Reserved Instances**: Not used in production
